1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:05,940
The seige of Gaza, cutting off all supplies of fuel
 the electricity plant, that's gone

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,040
there's no electricity, there's no running
water

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,769
there's no food going in, there are no other
fuel supplies going in

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,870
the border's closed at Egypt as well
there's highly little criticism of Egypt at

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:20,180
that, interestingly
Is that, and while raining down missiles on

6
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,890
buildings
which they know are going to kill civilians

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,080
we know hundreds and hundreds of civilians
already died

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,939
many of them children -
is that a reasonable, proportionate and moral

9
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:34,360
response
by Israel?

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,390
There's some deep perversion in Britain, whenever
Israel is involved in a conflict

11
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:45,620
and it is the word you just used: proportion
proportionate, proportionality

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:52,800
Only Britain is really obsessed with this
I've heard it the last few days insessidly

13
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,390
proportionality in conflict
rarely exists

14
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:59,140
but if we were to decide that we should have
this fetish

15
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,950
about proportionality
then that would mean that in retaliation for

16
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:07,250
what Hamas did
in Israel on Saturday

17
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,119
Israel should try to locate a music festival
in Gaza, for instance

18
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,799
and good luck with that...
should try to find a music festival in Gaza

19
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:20,939
and rape precisely the number of women
that Hamas raped on Saturday

20
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,549
kill precisely the number of young people
that Hamas killed on Saturday

21
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:30,110
they should find a town of exactly the same
size

22
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:33,299
as a town like Sderot
where I've been many times myself

23
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,600
and make sure they go door to door and kill
precisely the correct number

24
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:44,290
of babies that Hamas killed in Sderot on Saturday
and shoot in the head precisely the same number

25
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:47,930
of old-age pensioners
as were shot in Sderot on Saturday

26
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:52,790
just to choose one town
Proportionality in conflict is a joke

27
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,860
and it's a very strange British concept which
we've had

28
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,180
that only the Israeli's in the conflict, when
they are attacked

29
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,549
are expected to have precisely the proportionate
response
